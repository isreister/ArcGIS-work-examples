useful notes:
To obtain a subset of a large online database (e.g. Terrain), that is fit to your map, right click on the layer (e.g. Terrain)  in the contents panel, navigate to "Data>Export Raster".
Create the .tiff file usine display limits.
You now have a managable .tiff file that can be used to create contours or complete other data analysis on.
